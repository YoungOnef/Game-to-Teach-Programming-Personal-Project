# Game to Teach Programming - Programming Adventure

"Programming Adventure" is an engaging educational game that utilizes Lua programming language, offering a progressive learning experience from basic functions to conditional statements and loops. With immediate feedback and a discovery-based approach, it fosters creativity and problem-solving skills while reinforcing learning through a spiral curriculum. Powered by the Moon Sharp library, the game makes programming enjoyable and effective for all skill levels.

Please note that the game may run a bit slow for the WebGL build, so you may want to download the desktop version for better performance. I hope you enjoy the game and learn some programming skills along the way.

## Levels Overview (with corresponding screenshots)

The following screenshots show some of the levels that you can play in my game. These are the most simple levels to complete, as they introduce you to the basic concepts and functions of Lua programming language. As you progress through the game, you will encounter more challenging and complex levels that will test your coding skills and knowledge.

### Level Tutorial
Introduces the game’s interface and UI elements, such as the code editor, the game world, the buttons, and the instructions. Explains how to navigate and use the UI to write and run code. Prepares the user for the upcoming levels.

### Level 7
Introduces conditional statements, which are used to control the flow of the code based on certain conditions. Teaches how to use if-then-else statements to make decisions and execute different code blocks depending on the situation. Teaches how to use logical operators and comparison operators to create complex conditions. Improves the user’s code logic and flexibility.

### Level 8-10
Introduces loops, which are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Teaches how to use for loops and repeat-until loops to iterate over a sequence of values or until a condition is met. Teaches how to use break and continue statements to control the execution of loops. Increases the user’s code efficiency and automation.

### Level 11-15
Introduces while and do-while loops, which are used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true. Teaches how to use while loops and do-while loops to create infinite loops or loops with delayed conditions. Teaches how to use nested loops and loop variables to create more complex patterns. Expands the user’s code creativity and problem-solving skills.
